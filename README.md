# Youtube_clone_project
 Microverse 1st project - Youtube Player Layout Clone - Pair programming

<!-- Important note -->
We have 3 branches to save time; we split the work and then review together before merging.
We merged the final branch to master by mistake, so we review and did some minor changes to the HTML + CSS and the commit again to the "lfet-column" branch.

<!-- General requirements -->
For this project we have use flexbox.

For skeleton we have 4 main sections:

Header
Blue alert
Main = youtube video (description, user, comment) + side bar (minivideos)
Footer

Fontawesome was used for icons

We have normalize.css in a single file and style.css in another file.
